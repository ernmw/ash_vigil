Prioritized TOPIC_ASH_INTERMENT dialogue responses:

URN_DELIVERY_ACTIVE_GVAR=1 AND HAS_URN_GVAR=1: must be valid for all urn quest givers.
    - "Deliver your charge to their final resting place." No side-effects.
URN_DELIVERY_ACTIVE_GVAR=1 AND HAS_URN_GVAR=0: "Was the internment successful?" must be valid for all urn quest givers. Choice of responding:
    - "I lost the remains." This should have an attached result mwscript that contains the string "CK_LOST_URN".
       This will notify the lua that the active quest should be killed.
       The mwscript should reduce reputation in the faction and damage disposition, too.
    - "I'm working on it." No side-effects.


Urn quest stage is 50: "<custom success completion response for the quest>". Advance quest stage to 100 in the mwscript, and grant reputation and rewards! There's one of these per delivery quest.

URN_DELIVERY_ACTIVE_GVAR!=1 and quest stage is 0: "<custom dialogue for start of next quest. should tell you where it is and if you're ready to pick up the urn now>". There's one of these per delivery quest. Choice of responding:
    - "I'm ready. Give me the urn." Advance quest stage to 10 in the mwscript!
    - "Not yet." No side-effects.
